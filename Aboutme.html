    <h1>About me</h1>
    <img id="in-nature" src="star.jpg" alt="in nature" width="95"> 
    <p>I came to America about 5 years ago and got my citizenship a month ago. I cant wait to get my American passport and travel around the world with my siblings. I have one brother, his name is Arman like the luxury brand and a baby sister, her name is Tabassum (she is the cutest and smartest 3 year old that I know).</p>
 <img id="meeeeee" src="meeeeee.jpg" alt="me" width = "95">
 <p>I <em>love</em> reading and writing poems (because I am a hopeless romantic who likes to day dream a lot ðŸ¤­), but I also love going to new places and getting connected to nature, I love how animals can trust me enough to let me pet them or how much butterflies and ladybugs land on me. </p> 
 <p>Here is one of my poems that I am very proud of....</p>
<img id="writing" src="writing.jpg" alt="my writing" width = 95 >  

<p><em>Mesmerizing the cherry blossoms are, <br>
        They cease to fall when April parts. <br>
        A heavenly voice soars up into the sky. <br>
        Tis the crying of a caged bird in tears. <br>
        How helpless this life is, between the moon and sea. <br>
        Beside the waves Iâ€™ll wait, and sing my song for thee. 
    </em>  </p>
 <br>
    <p>Thank you for taking your time to know more about me. <strong>Stay tuned to learn more.</strong></p>
